# React Portfolio
## Description
Remember [that old portfolio I made](https://cooljh2k.github.io/my-portfolio/) a while back? Well now, I've remade it using React components!
### Why did I make this?
I made this because I wanted to show potential employers how much I know how to utilize React so far. React is a very important part of web development these days, so it's important that I have a good understanding of it to make a functional website!
### What problem does this solve?
Well, I didn't make this to try to solve a problem this time. I just wanted to show how much I understand the React library.
### What did I learn?
I have learned:
1. What JavaScript expressions (JSX) are and how they can be used with actual HTML.
2. What a React component is and how to link different components together.
3. How to apply styling to JSX both internally and with an external CSS stylesheet.
